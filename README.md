Tradition is tradition.

Tradition leads to procedures.
Procedures require knowledge.
Knowledge comes from actions.
Actions hone our skills.
Thus skills help maintain tradition and foster new knowledge.
New knowledge leads to novel actions.
Novel actions develop new procedures.
New procedures lead to innovation.
Innovation leads to new traditions.
Tradition is tradition.
